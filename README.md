# KevinZhu

KevinZhu is a CLI app for viewing Kevin Zhu's interactive resume.

## Installation
Make sure to include the --global flag if you want to be able to run it directly from the command line as described.
```bash
npm install --global kevinzhu
```
or (not recommended)
```bash
npm install kevinzhu
```

## Usage
Viewing KevinZhu is very simple. Just open kevinzhu in your Node.js terminal/command prompt.

```bash
kevinzhu
```
If KevinZhu was not installed globally, you can use npx to open the app (but it looks slightly worse).

```bash
npx kevinzhu
```

## Feedback
